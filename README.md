# Self_Driving_Car
This Project is an Obstacle avoiding car using ATmega32 microconroller. 
<br>
### Circuit Components 
- Ultrasound Sensor 
- 2 L2D29 motor driver 
- 4 DC motors 
- 1 Servo motor

### Implementation 
The 4 DC motors are controlled using the motor drivers to control the speed and direction of the car. The Ultrasound sensor is attached to the servo motor to scan the surroundings when detecting an obstacle nearby. After the sensor scan the surroundings the decision is made and the direction of the car is changed.
